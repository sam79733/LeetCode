class Solution(object):
    def firstUniqChar(self, s):

        :type s: str
        :rtype: int

        tempDict= {}
        for x in s:            
                if(x not in tempDict):
                    tempDict[x] = 1
                else:
                    tempDict[x] = tempDict[x] + 1
                    
        counter = 0
        for x in s:
            if(tempDict[x] == 1):
                return counter
            counter = counter + 1
        return -1
